# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assumptions
1. User automatically login using email: Shanna@melissa.tv. I save all about the login information in NavbarHeader component
2. User can only update or delete their post.
3. In the other hand, user can create, read, update, or delete all the comments. Because in the comments section, there is no userId

## Result
https://post-comment-bice.vercel.app/posts/11

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
